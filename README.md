# Bootstrapping CORDEX data: some experiments

![](reports/comparisons_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png)

In this repo I experimented with bootstrapping REMO2015 model data in an attempt to: (a) obtain confidence intervals for certain statistics and (b) assess the extent with which a bootstrapped REMO ensemble could emulate a REMO+RegCM ensemble. You can read the final report of my experiments [here](reports/comparisons.md).
